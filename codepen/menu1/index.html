          <div>1. According to a new study published in the journal Cell Tuesday by an international team of researchers, antibodies found in the blood of llamas were able to stave off COVID infections.</div>

        <li><a href="#">Tab2</a>
          <div>2. “This is one of the first antibodies known to neutralize SARS-CoV-2,” Jason McLellan, from the University of Texas at Austin and co-author of the study, said in a statement</div>
        </li>
        <li><a href="#">Tab3</a>
          <div>3. The researchers built on previous research from four years ago in which they found that the antibodies from a then 9-month-old llama named Winter were able to neutralize both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV viruses over six weeks.</div>
        </li>
        <li><a href="#">Tab4</a>
           <div>4. Surprisingly, this isn’t the first time llamas have been used in antibody research, as The New York Times reports. Llama antibodies have been used in work related to HIV and infleunza, where they helped discover promising therapies.</div>
        </li>
        <li><a href="#">Tab5</a>
          <div>5. “Vaccines have to be given a month or two before infection to provide protection,” McLellan said in the statement. “With antibody therapies, you’re directly giving somebody the protective antibodies and so, immediately after treatment, they should be protected.”</div>
